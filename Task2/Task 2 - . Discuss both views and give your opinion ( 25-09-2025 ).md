### Some people think that charity organizations should only offer help to people of their own country. But others believe that these organizations should give aid to people in great need wherever they live. Discuss both views and give your opinion



Although some people believe that charity organization should merely provide aid to  the citizens of their own country , I believe that the answer depends on the scale of each organization.
 
	citizens within their own contry 
	I believe the extent of support should depend on the scale and capacity of each 
	organization

There are some reasons why organizations should help to their own citizens. Firstly, with charity organizations that have small scale, it is suitable to support people on their country. 

	charity organizations that have small scale => small scale charity organizations
	 it is more pratical and feasible (kh·∫£ thi) to support

This is because those organizations often get restricted resource, only allows them to  effectively working their areas. 

	have limited resuorces, which ony allows them to work effectively within local areas 

As a result, they can closely monitor their activities because the members of organizations can be working on project without too wasting of travel expenses. 

Moreover, The organizations will have a suitable and proper act of assistance if they fathom clearly demands in the local.  

	the organizations can provide more targeted and appropriate assistance if they clearly 
	understand local needs

The reason is that , in fact, mostly charity organizations often primarily engage with the community and practically gain issues in the local. 

This was often omitted by some organizations because of geographical distance 

	this is often overlooked by organizations due to geographical distance

On the other hand, the large-scale charity organizations should help citizens who are in developing nations and address international issues.

	

In fact, the big organizations have financial and  human resources to support developing countries, in which assistance from small organizations is often sufficient to meet community needs

	where collaboration with local charities can enhance the effectiveness of their aid 

For example, several organizations, such as USAID, helps numerous communities out of poverty. 

	have helped numerous communities escape poverty

Besides that, with professional expertise and relationship with governments , large organizations can connect and provide cross-border solution in emergency cases on a global scale.


For instance, in the Covid-19 pandemic, organizations with large size , work in many continents distribute vaccine to other nations, this will show the power of international collaboration.

	large organizations operating across continents have ditributed vaccines to 
	nations
