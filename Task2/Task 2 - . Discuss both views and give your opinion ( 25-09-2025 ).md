### Some people think that charity organizations should only offer help to people of their own country. But others believe that these organizations should give aid to people in great need wherever they live. Discuss both views and give your opinion



Although some people believe that charity organization should merely provide aid to  the citizens of their own country , I believe that the answer depends on the scale of each organization.


There are some reasons why organizations should help to their own citizens. Firstly, with charity organizations that have small scale, it is suitable to support people on their country. This is because those organizations often get restricted resource, only allows them to  effectively working their areas. As a result. They can closely monitor their activities because the members of organizations can be working on project without too wasting of travel expenses. Moreover, The organizations will have a suitable and proper act of assistance if they fathom clearly demands in the local. The reason is that , in fact, mostly charity organizations often primarily engage with the community and practically gain issues in the local. This was often omitted by some organizations because of geographical distance 

On the other hand, the small charity organizations should help to citizens who are in developing nations and address to international issues. In fact, the big organizations have financial resource and strong human resource to support developing country which in assistance of small organizations at a local is sufficient. For example, several organizations, such as USAID, helps numerous communities out of poverty. Besides that, with professional expertise and relationship with governments , large organizations can connect and provide cross-border solution in emergency cases on a global scale. For instance, in the Covid-19 pandemic, organizations with large size , work in many continents distribute vaccine to other nations, this will show the power of international collaboration.
