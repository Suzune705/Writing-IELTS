Some people argument that the government ought to provide free education to students in university. I partly agree with idea since there are both benefits and drawbacks 

On the one hand , there are several advantages when the government provides free for students. Firstly, this help to reduce pressure finance for student. This is because when all impoverished students do not have to pay their tuition fee, they will have more opportunities for learning university. 
In some countries such Germany, where the tuition fees are abolished, students can be able to pursue higher education without the burden of debt. Otherwise, in America, where graduated students have to face with vast loans.

Secondly, The labor quality would be improved clearly if all students have rights access to education, regardless of their background. Moreover, Society have more advance competence human resource, promoting economical and social development. 

On the other hand, there are also sone drawbacks to this idea. Providing free education could place a heavy burden on the state budget. For instance, if all students are free-learned, the government would have to spend tremendous budget to offset the losses for that. Besides that, university could be lack of source of revenue to pay lectures a salary or invest in educational facilities such as research room, library. This makes the teaching quality will deteriorate. For example, Some countries students pay little or not tuition fees, however, they still complain about substandard facilities.


In a nutshell,  providing free education brings about so many benefits as improve the quality of labor as well as reduce pressure finance for student.
Nevertheless, it also poses some risks that would influence on the stage budget and the quality of facilities. As my opinion, the government should
offer tuition fees for students who have not good condition in terms of finance and background.
