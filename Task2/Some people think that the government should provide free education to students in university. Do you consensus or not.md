Some people argue that the government ought to provide free education to students in university. I partly agree with the idea since there are both benefits and drawbacks 

On the one hand, there are several advantages when the government provides free education for students. Firstly, this helps to reduce financial pressure on students. This is because when all impoverished students do not have to pay their tuition fee, they will have more opportunities for attending/pursing university education. 
In some countries such as Germany, where the tuition fees are abolished, students are able to pursue higher education without the burden of debt. Otherwise, in America, where graduate students have to face vast loans.

Secondly, The labor quality would be improved clearly if all students have rights access to education, regardless of their background. Moreover, society will have a more skilled and competent human workforce , promoting economical and social development. 

On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks to this idea. Providing free education could place a heavy burden on the state budget. For instance, if all students study for free, the government would have to spend a tremendous amount of the budget to offset the losses for that. Besides that, university could be lack of revenue to pay lecturers' salaries or invest in educational facilities such as research facilities and libraries. This makes the teaching quality deteriorate. For example, in some countries students pay little or not tuition fees, however, they still complain about substandard facilities.


In a nutshell, providing free education brings about so many benefits such as improving the quality of workforce as well as reducing pressure financial pressure on students.
Nevertheless, it also poses some risks that would influence the stage budget and the quality of facilities. In my opinion, the government should offer tuition fees for students who are in poor financial conditions or come from disadvantaged backgrounds
