###  Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues. Discuss both views and give your opinion ?



It is often argued that scientific research primarily addresses health issues around the world. However, some believe that other global challenges deserve more attention . This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own opinion 


Firstly, research into health offers a solution for global issues and improving the public health. 

This is because when global health crises that threaten to thousands of people solved by scientific research 

-  This is because scientific research can help solve global health crises that threaten the lives of thousands of people 

For example, Thanks to the sufficient investment , scientists have quickly developed a vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic. This proves that the field can effectively cope with emergency situations that related to global health issues ~~health in over the world~~. 

Moreover, The health sector can prolong the life ~~expectancies~~ expectancy through methods that treat  
(used to treat)  diseases once considered (incurable)~~to be non-curable disease~~. 

For instance, the advanced treatment methods for incurable conditions , particularly ~~root cell~~ (stem cells) help rescue ~~blood-cancel~~( blood-cancer) contribute to control disease status so that it becomes better and allowing patient life longer , happier relatives

- For example, advanced treatments such as stem cell therapy have been used to treat blood cancer, helping to control the disease and improve the patient's quality of life, which brings happiness to their families 

In spite of researching on health to yield many benefits,  many other fields ought to need more priority to confront imminent global menaces 

- In spite of  the many benefits yielded by health research , other scientific fields should be prioritized to address imminent global threats

The problems about environment are desperately crucial, notably research in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

- The problems related to the environment are extremely important, notably those involving renewable energy and sustainable agriculture 


The problems, namely , climate change and pollution are posing a serious threat to survival of all  life on earth. ~~Without~~ ( Failing to ) invest in environmental research can lead to grave ramifications such as food shortages ~~circumstance~~, which would have an effect on the community , regardless of people's health status. 

Besides that , Technology ~~is also~~ should also be emphasized because of its innovations have changed the fundamental of ~~many careers~~ industries, with applications that go beyond the scope of health care


~~Specially~~ In particular, The automation in production helps boost ~~boosting~~ ~~working~~ productivity and ~~yield~~ produce affordable products. Hence, it promotes economic growth and improves the quality of life.

In conclusion , while human health is undoubtedly an important area of research , I believe that environmental research and technological innovation deserve higher priority , as the tackle challenges take a toll on whole our planet
