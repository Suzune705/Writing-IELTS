### _**Some people think that space exploration is a waste of resources, while others think that it’s essential for mankind to continue to explore the universe in which we live. Discuss both views and give your opinion**_


It is often claimed that the exploration of outer space is an unnecessary expenditure, whereas others believe it is crucial for humanity to further investigate the cosmos we inhabit. Although , there are some opinions about explore space is so waste of resources , I believe that its benefits for humanity in the not far future

	Although some people believe that exploring space is such a waste of resources, I 
	believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, particularly interms of technological 
	progress and human survival

It must be acknowledged that space exploration could be criticized  because of some restricts that related to financial burden and resource relocation. Firstly, the conditions for exploring the outer space have to pay high expenditures cause pressure on the budget of government. This is because to advantage facilitate for exploring cosmos so it requires

	Space exploration is often critized due to financial burdens and the reallocation of 
	resources.
	
	Conducting space exploration requires extremely high expenditures , which place 
	pressure on the national budget
	
	tremendous thousand billion  => tremendous a mount of money 

to spend on development, facilities , research . As a result , national budgets become severely strained, and takes a toll on the other public services. Moreover, there are still many urgent problems that should be more prioritized than space exploration programs. The reason is that vast resources are potentially reallocated to tackle pressing issues such as poverty, medical care and education , inherently direct impact on the life of numerous individuals

	 Vast resource could be reallocated....
	 Medical care -> Healthcare
	 which directly impact 
	 The lives of numerous individuals
	 there are stil many urgent problems that should be given higher priority than..
	 
	
Nonetheless, I believe firmly that, the certain concerns are dominated by essential profits that exploring space bring to mankind. Space research leads to crucial scientific discoveries and advanced social technology. In fact, It is too hard to travel and explore space with outdated technologies. 

	 Although there are certain concerns, the significant benefits of space exploration  
	 outweigh them. Space research leads to crucial scientific discoveries and remarkable 
	 technological advancements. In fact, it is impossible to travel and explore outer 
	 space with obsolete techonogies

Therefore, we would have to offer novel and innovative solutions to create cutting-edge technologies, accordingly , they bring practical application encompass GPS , satellites to forecast weather , advanced medical equipment,  those which help improve the daily life of individuals. 

	 Therefore, goverment have to invest heavily in research and development, which drives 
	 the creation of cutting-edge techonolgies. Many of these , such as GPS, weather-
	 forecasting satellies and advanced medical quipment, have practical applications that 
	 improve daily life 
In addition, space discover help us address demand of survival as well as seek backup planet for us in the future.

	 Space discoveries may help humnity secure its survival by seeking alternative planets
	 
Currently , the earth is facing grave threats include climate changes, overpopulation , nature disaster. Thus, humankind must develop alternative living options and explore new resources to ensure the our long-term survival.

	 Ensure the long-term survival of humankind
